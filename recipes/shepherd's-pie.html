        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shepherd's pie is a comfort food casserole that originated in England. It's traditionally made with minced meat (usually ground lamb), gravy, vegetables, and mashed potatoes.</p>
        <p>You may also hear it called "cottage pie." The two terms are used interchangeably, but technically traditional shepherd's pie is made with ground lamb and traditional cottage pie is made with ground beef.</p>
        <h2>Shepherd's Pie ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground Beef: You could also ground lamb if you prefer.</li>
            <li>Mashed Potatoes: Use starchy potatoes (like russet or Yukon Gold) for the best mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes are also made with butter, onion, and Cheddar cheese.</li>
            <li>Vegetables: This shepherd's pie includes carrots and onions.</li>
            <li>Flour: All-purpose flour will thicken the beef gravy.</li>
            <li>Ketchup: Ketchup will add a little tang to the ground beef mixture.</li>
            <li>Beef Broth: Beef broth creates a gravy-like consistency in the middle.</li>
            <li>Cheese: Top the shepherd's pie with extra Cheddar for a cheesy finish.</li>
        </ul>
